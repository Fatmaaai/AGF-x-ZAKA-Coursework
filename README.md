# ZAKA AI/ML Certification – Project Portfolio (Oct 2024 – Apr 2025)

This repository contains selected Google Colab notebooks completed as part of the ZAKA Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Certification Program, supported by the Abdullah Al Ghurair Foundation.

The notebooks cover core machine learning techniques and practical AI applications, culminating in a final capstone project on Multimodal RAG systems.

## 📁 Contents

### 🧠 1. Machine Translation (NLP)
- Built a basic machine translation model using sequence-to-sequence LSTMs.
- Trained on English–French dataset.
- Demonstrated tokenization, padding, model architecture, and evaluation.

### 🎭 2. Mask Detection (Computer Vision)
- Developed a CNN-based image classification model to detect mask usage.
- Used OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and data augmentation techniques.
- Applied to real-world face mask detection scenarios for safety compliance.

### 🧹 3. Data Cleaning & EDA
- Focused on data preprocessing, visualization, and outlier detection.
- Used Pandas and scikit-learn pipelines.
- Prepared structured datasets for downstream ML tasks.

### 🔍 4. Final Project – Multimodal RAG System
- Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using Streamlit, FAISS, and LLMs.
- Indexed PDFs with embeddings to support semantic search and context-aware responses.
- Integrated UI for live document Q&A.
- Tools: Python, Streamlit, FAISS, Llama/LM Studio
